## Project #5 Seed Project

1. Run `npm install` once to install all of the node dependencies for this project.
2. Run `npm test` every time you want to run the unit tests against your code.

Your work should be added to the `student-work` folder. 

You will also need to update the `helper/AccountFactory.ts` file to glue your code with the test code.

**IMPORTANT:** You must not alter in any way the `common` and `helper` folders and any of their files.
